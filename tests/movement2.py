TO DO
* stage 1 *
- draw all tetrominoes 
- rotate them with arrow keys
- make rotation more efficient
* stage 2 *
- below stage 1, DO NOT delete stage 1
- draw the tetrominos falling (as
  in movement1
- rotate them as they fall
- ensure that they land properly (no 
  floating, no through the ground)

goal of this is to deal with rotation, first while 
stationary, then while falling.
