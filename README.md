# TETRIS
In the very very early stages <br>
physics, shapes, and more complex user interactions make this a more difficult project <br>
no of course I'm not just procrastinating the actual HTML

## TO-DO
- intuitive way to order teronimos that have already dropped to the floor
- sound effect for drop ending (hard vs soft)
- "trail" for hard drop
